1. **Assumption 1: The relevance of MIS in an AI-dominated digital world**

The authors might assume that Management Information Systems (MIS) are still relevant and necessary in the face of increasing technological advancements, such as AI.

Justification: This assumption is likely justified, given the rapid pace of technological change and the ongoing need for organizations to manage their information systems effectively. MIS can provide a framework for understanding how technology supports organizational strategy and operations, regardless of the presence of AI.

2. **Assumption 2: The importance of understanding the interplay between AI and MIS**

The authors might assume that there is still value in exploring the relationships between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Management Information Systems.

Justification: This assumption seems justified, as the intersection of AI and MIS can have significant implications for organizational performance, decision-making, and the management of information systems. Understanding these interplay dynamics can provide insights into how organizations can leverage AI to support their MIS efforts effectively.

3. **Assumption 3: The applicability of existing knowledge on MIS to an AI-dominated digital world**

The authors might assume that existing knowledge and theories from MIS can be applied to the context of an AI-dominated digital world.

Justification: This assumption is likely justified, given the ongoing relevance of established theoretical frameworks in MIS. However, it's also possible that new concepts and perspectives will emerge as a result of studying the intersection of AI and MIS.
