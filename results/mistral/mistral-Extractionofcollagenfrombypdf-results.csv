mistral,Raw_Extractionofcollagenfrombypdf_mistral,raw,What methodology or approach has been used to solve the problem or answer the question?," The study uses a combination of experimental methods and analyses to investigate the extraction and characterization of acid-soluble collagen (ASC) from by-products of Arapaima gigas and Colossoma macropomum scaling. The methodology involves three main steps: sample preparation, collagen extraction, and characterization.

1. Sample Preparation: The pirarucu scales were processed without the skin, while tambaqui scales were kept attached to the fish skin. All scales were washed, dried, cut into pieces, and either left uncrushed or crushed using a hammer mill before being subjected to further analysis.
2. Collagen Extraction: The samples were treated with sodium hydroxide for 12 hours, demineralized in a 10% sodium chloride solution for 24 hours, and underwent three dialysis cycles. Finally, the dialyzed materials were frozen and lyophilized to obtain ASC.
3. Collagen Characterization: The structural characterizations of collagens were carried out using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) with Attenuated Diffuse Reflectance (ATR) method.

In addition, the total lipid content was measured using the Soxhlet method, and the total nitrogen content was determined using the Kjeldahl method. The yield of collagen extractions was calculated using a specific equation.

The study aimed to compare the collagens obtained from tambaqui and pirarucu scaling. This comparison should provide insights into the potential use of these by-products in applications where collagen is a valuable component, such as food or pharmaceutical industries."
