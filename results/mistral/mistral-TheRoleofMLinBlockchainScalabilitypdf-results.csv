The case studies presented in the research illustrate the feasibility, impact, and challenges of deploying such systems in practical contexts, ranging from public blockchains to private enterprise solutions. For instance, ShardMap, a decentralized geo-aware ML sharding framework, demonstrated reduced shard maintenance costs by 22%, improved scalability without compromising data integrity or traceability, and enabled real-time audit trails for regulatory compliance.

Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the role of ML in blockchain scalability, paving the way for future advancements in this promising frontier. The open-source simulation platform NeoShardNet serves as a testbed for experimenting with sharding algorithms using simulated blockchain networks, further fueling innovation and democratizing access to these technologies across both public and private sectors."
