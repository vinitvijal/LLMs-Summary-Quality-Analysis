mistral,Raw_ArticleFilePdf202412311195182pdf_mistral,raw,What methodology or approach has been used to solve the problem or answer the question?," The methodology employed in this study is a corpus-based quantitative research design. This design was utilized to investigate the syntactic complexity and readability of advanced reading comprehension texts sourced from Educational English for Academic Purposes (EAP) textbooks and academic research papers across three distinct academic disciplines: Psychology, Accounting, and Pharmacy. The study paired each EAP textbook with research papers from the same discipline to ensure consistency and comparability across the corpora.

The analysis relied on the L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA) as the primary analytical tool, which was selected for its ability to assess multiple dependent variables simultaneously while accounting for their interdependence. Four dependent variables were incorporated: length of production unit, amount of subordination, amount of coordination, and degree of phrasal sophistication. The independent variable, corpus, consisted of six categories, each corresponding to a distinct textual source.

To ensure comparability, texts within each corpus were drawn from the same academic discipline, with equal numbers of passages selected from each source. This approach facilitated valid comparisons across corpora, as texts within each discipline shared common characteristics and functions. Statistical analyses, particularly MANOVA, were applied to assess how these syntactic features varied, providing a framework for identifying meaningful relationships and contrasts. The study aimed to answer the following questions:

1) How syntactically complex are the advanced-level comprehension texts practiced within EAP textbook materials?
2) How syntactically complex are advanced-level comprehension texts within respective academic research papers?
3) How differently/similarly is the advanced reading comprehension operationalized among these two types of sources (EAP textbook materials and advanced academic research papers)?"

mistral,Raw_ArticleFilePdf202412311195182pdf_mistral,raw,"What data or evidence has been used, and how was it collected or analyzed?"," The study has utilized two main types of data: textual data from educational English for Academic Purposes (EAP) textbooks and academic research papers in three distinct disciplines - Psychology, Accounting, and Pharmacy. These data were sourced specifically for examining the syntactic complexity and readability of advanced reading comprehension texts.

The process of collecting and organizing this data was meticulously designed to align with the study's research objectives. Firstly, specialized corpora focused on specific genres or varieties of language were compiled. To ensure consistency and comparability across the corpora, each EAP textbook was paired with research papers from the same discipline.

The L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA) tool was used as the primary analytical instrument to quantitatively evaluate key syntactic dimensions. This tool measures four dependent variables: Length of production unit, Amount of subordination, Amount of coordination, and Degree of phrasal sophistication.

To maintain balance, the analysis focused on discussion sections within the research papers. Each corpus consisted of 10 advanced reading passages, with an equal number selected from each text source to facilitate valid comparisons. Sampling from multiple disciplines enhanced the corpora's representativeness and supported the validity of the syntactic complexity analyses.

Statistical analysis methods, specifically Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), were applied to assess how these syntactic features vary. The findings from this analysis provided a framework for identifying meaningful relationships and contrasts across the text genres. Detailed information on the journals and research papers can be found in Appendix B, while more information on the linguistic analysis tools used is covered in the ""Data Analysis"" section of the study."
